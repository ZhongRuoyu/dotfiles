# dotfiles

Dotfiles that I use on macOS, Linux, Windows, and other systems.

## Installation

To install the dotfiles, run:

```shell
./install.sh
```

By default, the installation script does not prompt for confirmation before
overwriting files.
To request confirmation before attempting to overwrite files, run:

```shell
./install.sh -i
```
